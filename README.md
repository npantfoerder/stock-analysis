# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
I wrote a VBA script analyzing stock data and created buttons that run analysis and output the total daily volume and return of various companies. By refactoring my code I was able to create a more efficient version to help the customer analyze large sets of data in less time.

## Results
- Running analysis for all stocks in the year 2018 showed that only two companies, ENPH and RUN, had positive returns. DAQO's closing price decreased the most by 63% from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In the 'Total Daily Volume' column, it can be seen that DQ stock was traded the most and AY stock was traded the least.

- In the year 2017 all companies except for TERP had a positive return. DAQO's closing price increased the most by 199% from the beginning to the end of the year. Here 'Total Daily Volume' column tells us that SPWR stock was traded the most while DQ stock was traded the least.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
- In general, refactoring code is a useful way of increasing efficiency and decreasing run time. 

- For the case at hand, the refactored VBA script decreased the runtime by about ___ seconds. Although this might not seem like a big improvement, if we ran the same program on a much larger data set then we would be saving ourselves a lot of time.
