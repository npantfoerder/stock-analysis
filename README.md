# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
I wrote a VBA script analyzing stock data and created buttons that run analysis and output the total daily volume and return of various companies. By refactoring my code I was able to create a more efficient version to help the customer analyze large sets of data in less time.

## Results
- Running analysis for all stocks in the year 2018 showed that only two companies, ENPH and RUN, had positive return percentages. DAQO had the lowest return percentage of -63%. Here the 'Total Daily Volume' column tells us that DQ stock was traded the most and AY stock was traded the least.

- In the year 2017 all companies except for TERP had a positive return percentage. DAQO had the highest return percentage of 199%. In the 'Total Daily Volume' column, it can be seen that SPWR stock was traded the most while DQ stock was traded the least.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
- In general, refactoring code is a useful way of increasing efficiency and decreasing run time. 

- For the case at hand, the refactored VBA script decreased the runtime by about ___ seconds. Although this might not seem like a big improvement, if we ran the same program on a much larger data set then we would be saving ourselves a lot of time.
